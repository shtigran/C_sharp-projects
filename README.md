Here are shown my initial c# projects, in which have experimented the different properties and characteristics of **c# and #.NET.**  
In my projects You can see basics of c# and .NET:

  - Classes
  - Enum
  - Methods Overloading
  - Modificator_out_ref_param
  - Null
  - Structures
  - System.Array
  - System.Console methods
  - System.DateTime and System.Time Span
  - System.Enironment methods
  - System.string and stringBbuilder
  - Work with common types
